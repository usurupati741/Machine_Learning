This project examines the performance analysis by comparing three supervised machine learning methods applied to implement text classifications of Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-nearest Neighbors (KNN). Data preprocessing natural language processing processes were applied to the data, such as tokenization, stopword elimination, and TF-IDF transformation. All the models were trained and tested on conventional typifications of accuracy. Findings suggest that the Decision Tree algorithm gave the best training accuracy of 97.18% which is best compared to SVM and KNN. The paper demonstrates the efficiency of a tree-based approach in categorizing texts and provides some practical tips on how to choose the right algorithm in real-life settings where one has to work with the unstructured version of textual information.
